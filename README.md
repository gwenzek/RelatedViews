## Overview

This plugin allows you to link files to a given file.
Every time you open a file, all files that you linked to your main file will be opened next to it.

## Roadmap

Here is a list of feature I want to add before releasing:

[x] Allow to manually mark two files as related.
[x] Automatically open related file when you open a file.
[x] Close related files when you close a file.
[x] Relations are saved in the project data.
[ ] Configure in which group the related files should appear.
[ ] Allow to have bi-directional relationships (only main->related for now)
[ ] Support regexes so one can link all `*.h` to `*.cc`.
[ ] Add a command to cycle through related files.
